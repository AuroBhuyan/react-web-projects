# react-web-projects
A collection of small to medium-sized frontend projects built with React and Tailwind CSS â€” no heavy frameworks, no extra libraries. Each project is designed to strengthen core React fundamentals, covering topics like components, props, state management, event handling, hooks, conditional rendering, and reusable UI design.
